# Payroll Reconciliation Dashboard

This project is a payroll reconciliation tool that uses a Python backend with FastAPI and a vanilla HTML/JavaScript frontend. The backend uses a Gemini-powered agent to perform reconciliation checks on payroll data.

## Data Generation

The synthetic data used for the reconciliation checks in this project was generated by an AI.

## Project Structure

- `skeleton/backend/`: Contains the FastAPI backend application.
  - `main.py`: The main application file.
  - `agent/payroll_agent.py`: The agent that performs the reconciliation.
  - `requirements.txt`: The Python dependencies.
  - `.env`: The environment file to store the Gemini API key.
  - `input_files/`: The directory to upload files for processing.
  - `processed_files/`: This directory is not used in the current implementation.
  - `archive/`: Processed files are moved here.
- `skeleton/frontend/`: Contains the frontend application.
  - `index.html`: The main frontend file.

## Setup

### Backend

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd skeleton/backend
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    -   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    -   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Add your Gemini API key:**
    -   Open the `.env` file in the `skeleton/backend` directory.
    -   Replace `"your_gemini_api_key_here"` with your actual Gemini API key.

### Frontend

The frontend is a single HTML file and requires no setup.

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    -   Make sure you are in the `skeleton/backend` directory with the virtual environment activated.
    -   Run the following command:
        ```bash
        uvicorn main:app --reload
        ```
    -   The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2.  **Open the frontend:**
    -   Navigate to the `skeleton/frontend` directory.
    -   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## How to Use

1.  With the backend running and the frontend open in your browser, you can see the "Processing Steps".
2.  To trigger the reconciliation process, you need to add the 5 required data files to the `skeleton/backend/input_files` directory. The required files are:
    -   Master Data
    -   Pay Register for May
    -   Pay Register for June
    -   GL Data
    -   SIT Data
3.  The backend will automatically detect the files and start the reconciliation process.
4.  The frontend will update to show the status of the process and the final report.
